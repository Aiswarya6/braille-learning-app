# Braillr – A Braille Learning App (Prototype)

**Braillr** is a mobile app prototype designed to help users learn Grade 1 Braille through intuitive touch gestures and audio cues. Developed as part of a final-year design project at the Indian Institute of Technology Jodhpur, the app focuses on accessibility, simplicity, and user-guided learning.

---

## Overview

Braillr provides an accessible learning experience for visually impaired users by simulating a Braille keyboard with touch-based navigation and real-time audio feedback. The app supports multiple learning levels — from beginners to returning users — and emphasizes hands-on learning with minimal visual dependency.

---

## Features

- **Touch-based Navigation**: Use gestures (tap, swipe) to interact with the Braille keyboard.
- **Audio Prompts**: Audio feedback is triggered by touch, helping users stay oriented.
- **Progressive Learning Paths**:
  - **Beginners**: Introduced to Braille step-by-step.
  - **Returning Users**: Practice common words and maintain streaks.
  - **Intermediate Users**: Work with sentences, punctuation, numbers, and contractions.
- **Device Orientation Guidance**: Prompts to position the device correctly for Braille typing.
- **Minimal UI**: Designed for clarity and accessibility.
